\section{Algebraic lattices and cryptographic applications}

%La troisième partie du cours sera effectuée par Alice Pellet-Mary. Après des
%éléments de théorie algébrique des nombres, elle définira les variantes
%algébriques de LWE et SIS, ainsi que le problème NTRU,
%et présentera leurs liens avec les réseaux algébriques. Elle construira alors
%des primitives cryptographiques élémentaires à partir de ces problèmes.
%Enfin, elle abordera des aspects de cryptanalyse et présentera des attaques
%exploitant la structure algébrique sous-jacente à ces problèmes.

In this section, we will discuss about structured lattices, and the corresponding structured variants of the LWE and SIS problem. We will also see a new algorithmic problem, called the NTRU problem.\footnote{This problem was originally defined as a structured lattice problem, and later generalized to a less structured (and even unstructured) version of itself.}

One of the main reason for introducing structure in lattices and lattice problems is to improve the efficiency of the cryptographic schemes based on lattices. Let's be clear here, schemes based on unstructured lattice problems such as (plain) LWE and SIS are \emph{not} inefficient, they are already somewhat efficient. But adding structure to the lattice can make them even more efficient, which makes everyone happier.
In order to see why the structure can make scheme more efficient, imagine that you have a lattice which has one basis $\vec B$ which is a circulant matrix, i.e., it is of the form
\begin{align*}
\vec B = \begin{pmatrix}
b_{1} & b_{2} & \dots & b_n \\
b_n & b_1 & \dots & b_{n-1} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
b_{2} & b_3 & \dots & b_1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Then, storing this basis of you lattice only requires storing $n$ coefficients, instead of $n^2$ for an unstructured matrix. Also, multiplying this matrix with a vector can be done in quasi-linear time $O(n \cdot \poly( \log n) )$, instead of quadratic time $O(n^2)$.
Let's remark here that a structured lattice only need to have a few structured bases. Not all bases need to have this special structure (and in general, not all bases will have this visible structure indeed). But as long as we can compute a nicely structured basis, then we can enjoy the benefits of the structure on the storage space, and the running time of basic operations (like matrix-vector multiplication).

On the negative side, adding structure to the lattices may render the algorithmic problems based on these lattices easier to solve. From a cryptographic perspective, this would mean making the cryptographic constructions based on these problems weaker against attackers. It is then important to choose wisely the structure one adds to the lattices, and to study the impact of this structure on potential attacks.
There have been examples of poorly chosen structure, leading to attacks on the structured schemes \cite{BLA}.

On the other hand, we also have examples of good choice of structure,\footnote{Understand here that they are good \emph{so far}. They might become ``poorly chosen'' in a few months/years if someone manages to exploit the structure to find better attacks.} for which the best known attack is the same as the best known attack against unstructured lattices (i.e., for the moment, the only way we know to solve some algorithmic problems in these lattice is to forget about the structure, and use standard attacks against unstructured lattice problems).

The structure we will consider in this section is a special case of what is called \emph{modules over the ring of integers of a number field}. In order to make this name shorter, we will simply call these \emph{module lattices} in the rest of these lecture notes, as is commonly done in the cryptographic community. We will see in details what those objects are in Section~\ref{sec:number-theory} below. Module lattices are, by far, the most widely used structured lattices in lattice-based cryptography at the moment. If chosen appropriately, they may fall in the category of ``good structured lattices'' defined above, in the sens that, at the moment, we don't know how to solve standard algorithmic problems in these lattices (such at SVP) more efficiently than in non structured lattices.
Before moving to the formal definition of module lattices, let us mention the existence of other kinds of structured lattices (which won't be covered here), such as ideals over a maximal order of a cyclic algebra~\cite{CLWE}.


\subsection{Background on Number Theory}
\label{sec:number-theory}
In this section, we review some definitions and results of number theory that will be useful for the rest of the course. The last subsections are a little bit more advanced, and will be used only for the cryptanalysis part (Section~\ref{sec:cryptanalysis}). Most of the results that are recalled in this section and their proofs can be found in~\cite{Marcus}.
\subsubsection{Number fields}

A number field $K$ is a field, containing $\QQ$, and which has \emph{finite dimension} when seen as a vector space over $\QQ$.\footnote{Any field containing $\QQ$ can be seen as a vector space over $\QQ$, but not all of them have finite dimension as a $\QQ$-vector space. For instance, $\RR$ and $\CC$ are $\QQ$-vector spaces of infinite dimension.} The dimension of $K$ over $\QQ$ is called the \emph{degree} of the number field $K$, and denoted by $[K:\QQ]$. In these lecture notes, by convention, we will use the letter $d$ to denote the degree of a number field (when there is no conflict of notation).

There are multiple ways to represent number fields. The most frequent ones are seeing them as subsets of $\CC$, or as polynomial rings. In these lecture notes, we will adopt the polynomial ring representation, which will be more convenient.

\begin{lemma}
\label{le:nb-field-eq-def}
Let $P \in \QQ[X]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d$. Then the polynomial ring $\QQ[X]/P(X)$ is a number field of degree $d$.
Conversely, if $K$ is a number field of degree $d$, then there exists an irreducible polynomial $P$ of degree $d$ such that $K$ is isomorphic (as a field) to $\QQ[X]/P(X)$.
\end{lemma}

In the rest of these lecture notes, let us fix an irreducible monic polynomial $P$ of degree $d$, and define $K = \QQ[X]/P(X)$. Note that for any polynomial $f(X) \in \QQ[X]$, there is a unique polynomial $g(X) \in \QQ[X]$ with degree $< d$ and such that $f(X) = g(X) \bmod P$. We will represent elements of $K$ by the unique representative of their class which has degree $< d$. In other words, we see $K$ as the set $\{\sum_{i = 0}^{d-1} x_i X^i\,|\, x_i \in \QQ\}$ (where operations are performed modulo $P$). With this representation, we see that $\QQ$ is indeed contained in $K$, as the set of all polynomials of degree $0$.

\begin{example}\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Taking $P = 1$ leads to $K = \QQ$, the simplest of all number field. This is not a very interesting one, but keeping it in mind can be useful sometimes, to gain some intuition about what is happening.
\item A very common choice of polynomial $P$ in cryptography is $P = X^d+1$, where $d$ is a power-of-two. This polynomial is a cyclotomic polynomial (its roots are the primitive $(2d)$-th roots of unity), and the field $K$ associated to it is called a cyclotomic field. Cyclotomic fields have been extensively studied and they enjoy nice properties, that can be useful in cryptography, both for constructing cryptographic primitives, and for cryptanalysis. Most of the schemes using structured lattices today rely on power-of-two cyclotomic fields.
\item An other famous choice of polynomial is $P = X^p-X-1$, with $p$ a prime number. These polynomials are used in the NTRU Prime construction~\cite{NTRUPrime}, and we will call the associated field $K$ an NTRU Prime field. An interesting property of these fields is that they have no subfields, i.e., there exist no field $L$ such that $\QQ \varsubsetneq L \varsubsetneq K$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\paragraph{Ring of integers.} A number field $K$ contains a special sub-ring, called the \emph{ring of integers} of the number field (also called sometimes the maximal order of the number field). It is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:ring-of-integers}
Let $K$ be a number field. The ring of integers $\O_K$ of $K$ is the subset of $K$ formed by all the elements that are integral over $\ZZ$, i.e., all elements $x$ of $K$ such that there exists a monic irreducible polynomial $P_x \in \ZZ[X]$ satisfying $P_x(x) = 0$.
\end{definition}

It can be proven that this set $\O_K$ is indeed a ring (but not a field). Moreover, $\O_K$ is a $\ZZ$-module of rank $d$, i.e., there exists $d$ elements $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d \in \O_K$ such that any element $x \in \O_K$ can be uniquely written as $x = \sum_i x_i \alpha_i$, with $x_i \in \ZZ$. Such elements $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d)$ also form a $\QQ$-basis of the $\QQ$-vector space $K$. They are called an \emph{integral basis} of $K$.

\begin{example}\ 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $K = \QQ$, then $\O_K = \ZZ$, and $(1)$ is an integral basis of $K$.
\item If $K = \QQ[X]/(X^d+1)$ with $d$ a power-of-two, then $\O_K = \ZZ[X]/(X^d+1)$. Moreover, $(1,X, \dots, X^{d-1})$ is an integral basis of $K$.
\item In full generality, if $K = \QQ[X]/P(X)$ with $P$ irreducible, then $\ZZ[X]/P(X) \subseteq \O_K$, but we might not have equality.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

One of the consequence of the existence of integral bases is that elements of $K$ can be seen as fractions, with numerators in $\O_K$ and denominators in $\ZZ$ (by default, the denominators would have been in $\O_K$ too), as stated in the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
Any $x \in K$ can be written as $x = \frac{z}{n}$ with $z \in \O_K$ and $n \in \ZZ_{>0}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Take an integral basis $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d)$ of $K$ and let $x_i \in \QQ$ be such that $x = \sum_i x_i \alpha_i$. Then taking $n$ to be the least common multiple of all the denominators of the $x_i$'s gives the desired result.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Complex embeddings.} There exists always $d$ fields homomorphisms from $K$ to $\CC$,\footnote{We impose here that the field homomorphism sends $1$ to $1$, which avoids the trivial function sending every element of $K$ to $0$.} called the \emph{complex embeddings} of $K$. Note that field homomorphisms are always injective, and that they fix $\QQ$ point-wise. Let us write $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_d$ these complex embeddings. Some of them may have their image lying fully in $\RR \subset \CC$. We call those real embeddings, and we will write $d_\RR$ their number. If $\sigma$ is a complex embedding whose image is not fully contained in $\RR$, then $\overline{\sigma}$ (defined by $\overline{\sigma}(x) = \overline{\sigma(x)}$) is also a complex embedding. We say that $\sigma$ and $\overline{\sigma}$ are conjugate. Let $d_{\CC}$ be the number of such pairs of conjugate complex embeddings. Then we have $d = d_\RR + 2 d_\CC$. In the rest of this course, we order the complex embeddings such that $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_{d_\RR}$ are real embeddings, and $(\sigma_i, \sigma_{i+d_\CC})$ are pairs of conjugate embeddings for $d_\RR < i \leq d_\RR+d_\CC$.

\begin{lemma}
Let $K = \QQ[X]/P(X)$ with $P$ irreducible, and let $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_d$ be the $d$ roots of $P$ in~$\CC$. Then, the complex embeddings of $K$ are exactly the functions
\begin{align*}
\sigma_i: \ \ \ K & \rightarrow \CC \\
                f(X) & \mapsto f(\alpha_i)
\end{align*}
for $i \in \{1, \dots, d\}$.\footnote{Here, $f$ is a polynomial in $\QQ[X]$ of degree $< d$. We use the fact that $P(\alpha_i) = 0$, which implies that reduction modulo $P$ does not change the output of the function, and so the function is well defined over $\QQ[X]/P(X)$.}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First of all, one can check that the functions $\sigma_i$ defined in the lemma are indeed field homomorphisms, with image in $\CC$, as desired. Moreover, since $P$ is irreducible, then all the roots $\alpha_i$ are distinct, and so the functions $\sigma_i$ are distinct too (since they have distinct evaluations at~$X$).

If we admit that there are only $d$ complex embeddings for $K$, then we are done. However, since the proof is instructive, we will also prove that any complex embedding of $K$ is one of the~$\sigma_i$. This will also prove that there are exactly $d$ complex embeddings (which we have admitted above).

Let $\sigma$ be a complex embedding. Since it is a field homomorphism and since it fixes $\QQ$, then the knowledge of $\sigma(X)$ uniquely determines $\sigma$. Indeed, if $\beta = \sigma(X) \in \CC$, then for any $f(X) = \sum_i f_i X^i \in K$ (with $f_i \in \QQ$), we have $\sigma(\sum_i f_i X^i) = \sum_i f_i \beta^i = f(\beta)$.
Moreover, since $P(X) = 0$, then we should have $P(\beta) = P(\sigma(X)) = \sigma(P(X)) = \sigma(0) = 0$. So $\beta$ is a complex root of $P$, i.e., it is one of the $\alpha_i$'s. This proves that $\sigma$ is equal to one of the $\sigma_i$'s.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
If $K = \QQ[X]/(X^d+1)$ with $d$ a power-of-two, then $d_\RR = 0$, $d_\CC = d/2$ and the $d$ complex embeddings of $K$ are obtained by sending $X$ to all the primitive $(2d)$-th roots of unity in $\CC$ (there are $\varphi(2d) = d$ such primitive roots, which are exactly the roots of $X^d+1$).
\end{example}

\paragraph{Trace and norm.} The trace $\Tr$ and algebraic norm $\N$ are functions from $K$ to $\CC$ defined as follows. For any $x \in K$
\begin{align*}
\Tr(x) &= \sum_{i = 1}^d \sigma_i(x) \\
\N(x) &= \prod_{i = 1}^d \sigma_i(x)
\end{align*}
\begin{lemma}
For any $x \in K$, the trace and the norm of $x$ are in $\QQ$ (and not only in $\CC$). Moreover, if $x \in \O_K$, then $\Tr(x)$ and $\N(x)$ are in $\ZZ$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}
If $K = \QQ[X]/(X^2+1)$ and $x = a+bX$, then
\begin{align*}
\Tr(x) &= (a+ib) + (a-ib) = 2a \\
\N(x) &= (a+ib) \cdot (a-ib) = a^2+b^2
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
The trace is additive and the algebraic norm is multiplicative. I.e., for any $x, y \in K$, it holds that
\begin{align*}
\Tr(x+y) &= \Tr(x) + \Tr(y) \\
\N(xy) &= \N(x) \cdot \N(y)
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Ideals} For any commutative ring $R$, an \emph{ideal} $I$ of $R$ is a subset of which is an additive group, and is stable by multiplication by an element of $R$, i.e., for all $x in I$ and $\alpha \in R$, it holds that $\alpha x \in I$. In our context with number fields $K$ and ring of integers $\O_K$, we will consider ideals of $\O_K$, as well as a generalization of those.

\begin{definition}
Let $K$ be a number field and $\O_K$ its ring of integers.
\begin{itemize}
\item An \emph{integral ideal} of $K$ is an ideal of $\O_K$, for the definition given above. By convention, we will use Gothic letters $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}, \cdots$ to denote integral ideals.
\item A \emph{fractional ideal} of $K$ is a subset $I \subset K$ of the form $x \cdot \mathfrak{a} := \{x \cdot a\,|\, a \in \mathfrak{a}\}$ for some $x \in K^*$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ an integral ideal of $K$. By convention, we will use capital letters $I, J, \cdots$ to denote fractional ideals.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Note that $K$ is a ring, and so one can define the ideals of $K$ when seen as a ring. However, since $K$ is also a field, it only has two ideals: $K$ and $\{0\}$. Those are not very interesting, and we will never consider ideals of $K$ in these lecture notes. Instead, we will sometimes use the terminology ``ideal of $K$'' to refer to fractional ideals of $K$ (and we will always specify ``\emph{integral} ideal if $K$'' when they are integral).

\begin{example}
For $K = \QQ$ and $\O_K = \ZZ$, the set $\mathfrak{a} = \{3x\,|\, x \in \ZZ\}$ is an integral ideal of $K$. And the set $I = \{5x/7 \,|\, x \in \ZZ\}$ is a fractional ideal of $K$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
A fractional ideal $I$ of $K$ is said to be \emph{principal} if it is of the form $\alpha \O_K := \{ \alpha \cdot x\,|\, x \in \O_K\}$ for some $\alpha \in K$. In this case, $\alpha$ is called a \emph{generator} of $I$ (it is usually not unique).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
The two ideals from the previous example are principal, with generators $3$ and $5/7$ respectively. This is not a coincidence, all ideals in $\ZZ$ are principal, we say that $\ZZ$ is a principal ideal domain (PID).
In general, the ring $\O_K$ may not be principal, meaning that there exists ideals that are not generated by a single element.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
Any fractional ideal $I$ can be generated by at most $2$ elements of $K$, i.e., there exists $\alpha, \beta \in K$ such that $I = \{ \alpha \cdot x + \beta \cdot y \,|\, x, y \in \O_K\}$.
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Arithmetic over ideals.} In a number field $K$, we will want to do arithmetic over the fractional ideals. We will see below that, while the ring $\O_K$ might not have the same nice arithmetic properties as the ring $\ZZ$ (for instance, we usually do not have euclidean division in $\O_K$, and sometimes not even unique factorization), everything works better if we consider ideals of $\O_K$, rather than elements of $\O_K$.

\begin{definition}
Let $I$ and $J$ be two fractional ideals. We define the addition and multiplication of $I$ and $J$ as
\begin{align*}
I + J &= \{x + y \,|\, x \in I, y \in J\} \\
I \cdot J &= \{ \sum_{i = 1}^r x_i \cdot y_i \,|\, r > 0, x_i \in I, y_i \in J\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
When $K = \QQ$ and $\O_K = \ZZ$, we have $6\ZZ + 8 \ZZ = 2\ZZ$, and $2 \ZZ \cdot 3 \ZZ = 6 \ZZ$.

When the ideals are integral, the addition of two ideals corresponds to their gcd, i.e., if $x, y \in \ZZ$, then $x \ZZ + y \ZZ = \gcd(x,y) \ZZ$. More generally, in an arbitrary number field $K$, the sum of two integral ideals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ is the smallest (for inclusion) integral ideal containing both $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$.

In any number field $K$, if $I = \alpha \O_K$ and $J = \beta \O_K$ are principal, then we always have $I\cdot J = (\alpha \cdot \beta)\O_K$.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
The sum and product of two fractional ideals is still a fractional ideal. Moreover, the set of non-zero fractional ideal forms a multiplicative group with neutral element $\O_K$, i.e., for any non-zero fractional ideal $I$, there exists a non-zero fractional ideal $J$ such that $I \cdot J = \O_K$. This ideal $J$ is called the inverse of $I$, and we write it $I^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}

There exists also a notion of prime ideals in $K$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{prime ideal} $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$ is an \emph{integral} ideal such that for any two elements $\alpha, \beta \in \O_K$, if $\alpha \cdot \beta \in \mathfrak{p}$, then it must be that either $\alpha \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $\beta \in \mathfrak{p}$.
We will also assume in these lecture notes that a prime ideal is non-zero.\footnote{The convention usually consists in accepting $\{0\}$ as a prime ideal, and writing everywhere ``non-zero prime ideal''. We exclude $\{0\}$ from the beginning to avoid unnecessary heavy notations.}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Over $\ZZ$, the prime ideals are exactly the ideals $p \cdot \ZZ$, where $p$ is a prime integer.

In $K = \QQ[X]/(X^2+1)$ and $\O_K = \ZZ[X]/(X^2+1)$, the principal ideal $\mathfrak{a} := (1+X) \cdot \O_K$ is prime. To see this, one can first check that an element $a + bX \in \O_K$ is divisible by $1+X$ if and only if $a = b \bmod 2$. Hence, $\mathfrak{a} = \{a + bX \,|\, a, b \in \ZZ, a = b \bmod 2\}$. Let $x = a+bX$ and $y = c+dX$ be in $\O_K$ and such that $x \cdot y \in \mathfrak{a}$. We have $x \cdot y = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)X$, and so by the property above, we know that $ac-bd = ad+bc \bmod 2$. One can check that this equation implies that either $a = b \bmod 2$ or $c = d \bmod 2$ (for instance, by testing all the $2^4$ possible values of $a,b,c$ and $d$ modulo $2$). Hence, either $x$ of $y$ is in $\mathfrak{a}$, as desired.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
Any \emph{integral} ideal of $K$ can be factored in a unique way (up to permutation of the terms) as a product of prime ideals. In other words, for any integral ideal $\mathfrak{a}$, there exists a unique sequence of non-negative integers $(n_\mathfrak{p})_{\mathfrak{p}}$, ranging over all prime ideals and non-zero only for a finite number of prime ideals, such that $\mathfrak{a} = \prod_{\mathfrak{p}} \mathfrak{p}^{n_\mathfrak{p}}$.

\noindent For fractional ideals $I$, there is also a unique factorization, but exponents may be negative, i.e., $I = \prod_{\mathfrak{p}} \mathfrak{p}^{x_\mathfrak{p}}$ where $x_\mathfrak{p} \in \ZZ$ is zero for almost all primes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}
In $K = \QQ[X]/(X^2+1)$, we have $2 \O_K = \mathfrak{p}^2$, where $\mathfrak{p} = (1+X) \cdot \O_K$ is the prime ideal from the previous example. To see this, note that $(1+X)^2 = 2X \bmod X^2+1$, so $\mathfrak{p}^2 = (2X) \cdot \O_K$. But since $X$ is inertible in $\O_K$ (with inverse $-X$), the ideals $(2X) \cdot \O_K$ and $2 \O_K$ are equal.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
An integral ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime if and only if the quotient space $\O_K/\mathfrak{a}$ has no divisors of zero. In our case, this is equivalent to $\O_K/\mathfrak{a}$ being a field (because it is a finite, commutative ring).
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Algebraic norm.} The algebraic norm of an non-zero integral ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ is $\N(a) = |\O_K/\mathfrak{a}|$, i.e., it is the index of $\mathfrak{a}$ in $\O_K$. This is an positive integer. For a non-zero fractional ideal $I = x \cdot \mathfrak{a}$, with $x \in K$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ an integral ideal, the algebraic norm is defined as $\N(I) = |\N(x)| \cdot |\N(\mathfrak{a})|$. This is a positive rational number, and it does not depend on the choice of $x$ and $\mathfrak{a}$.

\begin{properties}
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $I = \alpha \O_K$ is principal, then $\N(I) = |\N(\alpha)|$;
\item the norm is multiplicative, i.e., for $I$ and $J$ fractional ideals, we have $\N(I \cdot J) = \N(I) \cdot \N(J)$;
\item if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal, then $\N(\mathfrak{p}) = p^k$ for some $k \geq 1$ and $p$ a prime integer;
\item\label{prop:norm-included} for an integral ideal $\mathfrak{a}$, we have $\N(\mathfrak{a}) \in \mathfrak{a}$ (when seeing $\N(\mathfrak{a})$ as an element of $K$ via the inclusion $\ZZ \subset K$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{properties}


\paragraph{Computational aspects.} $\ZZ$-basis of ideals. The fact that we can go from $2$-elements representation to basis in polynomial time and conversely. The fact that we can add and multiply efficiently, and factor ideals if we can factor integers.
